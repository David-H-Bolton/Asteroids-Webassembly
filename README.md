# Asteroids-Webassembly
A conversion of  C program to run in a browser. This requires the 11 png files (put them in a folder called assets). It compiles with Visual C++ 2017 Community edition but requires SDL2 and SDL_Image to be installed. 

The build.bat file builds it using Emscripten if that is installed.
